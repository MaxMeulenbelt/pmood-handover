# pmood-handover
This repo serves as a handover for the latest version of the parent mood app.

The current codebase is not fully functional as there were severe bugs in the android version of the app that led to a lot of breaking changes needing to be made. I was no longer able to continue dev work on this project due to a lack of time once I started working full time but I hope whoever picks this up can find the time to complete the project.
